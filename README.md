## Solution to Product Manager
    To further improve the project, we could engineer a simple GUI that would allow users 
    to choose teams/sides and highlight areas of interest on the map. 
    Using a GUI would be a really simple way for people who aren't tech savy to request 
    and acquire the information they desire. In addition to that, it should take less than 
    1 weeks worth of work to fully implement the project.
